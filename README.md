# **📊 Building a Scalable Data Warehouse with ELT, EDA, and Advanced Analytics for Business Intelligence**

---

## **1️⃣ Data Warehouse Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold Layers)**

To ensure **efficient data storage, processing, and retrieval**, we structured the data warehouse into three layers:

### **🔹 Bronze Layer (Raw Data Storage) 🏗️**
✅ **Purpose:** Stores raw, unprocessed data from different sources.
✅ **Key Features:**
- Data stored **as-is** for debugging and traceability.
- No transformations applied.
- Used mainly by **Data Engineers**.

💡 **Example:** Suppose we are working with customer purchase data. The raw file from the source might contain missing values, inconsistent formats, or duplicate records.

---

### **🔹 Silver Layer (Clean & Standardized Data) 🏛️**
✅ **Purpose:** Standardizes and prepares data for analysis.
✅ **Transformations Applied:**
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing data, correct formats.
- **Data Standardization**: Ensure consistent date formats, numerical precision.
- **Derived Columns**: Create new attributes based on existing ones.
- **Data Enrichment**: Merge data from different sources.

---

### **🔹 Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data) 🏆**
✅ **Purpose:** Provides **final, aggregated** data for analytics and reporting.
✅ **Transformations Applied:**
- **Data Integration**: Combining multiple datasets.
- **Data Aggregation**: Summarizing data (e.g., total sales per region).
- **Business Logic & Rules**: Implementing domain-specific rules.

🎯 **Target Audience:** Business analysts and executives who use this data for **decision-making and reporting**.

## **2️⃣ ELT Process (Extract, Load, Transform) 🔄**

### **🔹 Extraction 📥**
✅ **Method:** Pull extraction from source systems (databases, APIs, flat files).
✅ **Type:** Full extraction (extracting all records).
✅ **Technique Used:** File Parsing (Reading and processing structured/unstructured files).

### **🔹 Load (Storing into Warehouse) 📦**
✅ **Processing Type:** Batch Processing.
✅ **Load Method:** Full Load (Truncate & Insert).
✅ **Slow Changing Dimensions (SCD1 - Overwrite):** Overwrite old records instead of keeping history.

### **🔹 Transform (Data Processing) 🔧**
Includes:
- **Data Cleaning** – Removing duplicates, handling missing data, and standardizing formats.
- **Data Enrichment** – Adding additional attributes to enhance analysis.
- **Data Integration** – Merging datasets from different sources.
- **Derived Columns** – Creating new insights (e.g., calculating "Profit Margin" from revenue and cost).
- **Data Aggregation** – Summarizing data for reporting.

## **3️⃣ Data Analytics & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 🔍**

### **🔹 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 📊**
✅ **Database Exploration:** Understanding data structure and relationships.
✅ **Dimension Exploration:** Analyzing categorical attributes (e.g., products, regions).
✅ **Date Exploration:** Identifying trends and seasonality.
✅ **Ranking (Top-N / Bottom-N):** Finding best/worst performers.

---

## **4️⃣ Advanced Analytics & Report Building 📈**

### **🔹 Change Over Time (Trends Analysis) 📅**
✅ **What is it?**
- Examines how key metrics **change over time** to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality.

✅ **How to do it?**
1. Aggregate data by **daily, weekly, or monthly** periods.
2. Use **line charts** or **bar charts** to visualize trends.
3. Identify **seasonality, spikes, and trends**.

✅ **Example Data: Monthly Sales Trend**

| Month  | Sales ($) |
|--------|---------|
| Jan    | 10,000  |
| Feb    | 12,000  |
| Mar    | 15,000  |
| Apr    | 9,000   |
| May    | 14,500  |
| Jun    | 18,000  |

✅ **Insights We Get:**
- 📊 Sales are **increasing**, with a dip in April.
- 📈 Helps in **forecasting future sales**.
- 📌 Seasonal fluctuations can be analyzed for **strategic planning**.

---

### **🔹 Reporting in SQL 📜**
✅ **What is it?**
- SQL queries generate reports that help in **business decision-making**.

✅ **Example Query:** Sales Performance Report
```sql
SELECT region, 
       SUM(sales) AS total_sales, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers, 
       AVG(sales) AS avg_sales_per_customer
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
✅ **Insights We Get:**
- 🏆 Identifies top-performing **regions**.
- 📊 Helps understand **customer spending patterns**.
- 📌 Useful for **regional sales strategy planning**.
